Three machine learning models were developed to predict Young's modulus of four CFRPs that are the combination of two fibres and two resins. The code extracts the data from an Excel sheet on an online drive, one-hot encodes the data, visualizes it then applies the three machine learning models to the data. The data is split into train set, validation set and test set. 

Step 1
Collect and data enter it into an Excel and upload to a drive.
